# Koum UI ✨

**Koum UI** is a personal, accessible UI components library built with **React** and **TypeScript**.  
Its purpose is to speed up development across my React projects by providing a reusable, consistent component base.  
More components will be added progressively.

## ♿ Accessibility

All components follow WCAG and WAI-ARIA guidelines as much as possible.
Focus management, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support are prioritized.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Koum UI is designed for projects using:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## 📦 Installation

```shell
npm install @...
```

## 🛠️ Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from 'koum-ui';

function App() {
    return <Button label="Click me" color="primary" />;
}
```

💡 All components are accessible by default and customizable via props.

## 🧩 Components

Currently, Koum UI includes the following components:

- Button
- Label
- (More coming soon...)

## 🧪 Development

To run this project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/koum-ui.git

You can use Storybook to preview components during development:
